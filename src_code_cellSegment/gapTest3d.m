% test if the gap is significant enough in a 3D manner
%INPUT:
% L: the label of regions segmented by principal curvature
% n: number of regions segmented by principal curvature
% vidComp: the original image data (Comp means alreay cropped as all other inputs)
% idComp: the label of regions before segmentation by principal curvature
% eigComp: eigen values of all foreground voxels
% fmap: map of valid eigen value, (eigen value > threshold)
% connect: 6, 26 (TODO: 10(8+2)) connection for connecting edges in the graph
% cost_design: how to design the cost in the Graph-Cut
% edgeConnect: in edgeTest, the way to determine neighbors, (default 124 as 5*5*5)
% p_thres: pvalue threshold to define significant gaps
% OrSt: structure from order statistics, containing data noise variance, mu
% and sigma from order statistics (maybe empty)
%OUTPUT:
% newLabel: new segmentation which merges some segments by removing all
% fake gaps
% regTest: 1=>pixels of edge between two cells, 2=>pixels of cell for testing,
% 3=>pixels of the other cell for testing
